## ‚ú® Result


## üîñ Solution

This competition is my first image classification competition,
so many part of my solution came from discussions in this competition.
I don't have strong single model, but ensemble is suprised me.

### üé® Base Model

- EfficientNet B4 with Noisy Student
- SE-ResNeXt50 (32x4d)
- Vision Transformer (base patch16)

| Train          | Inference          | Public LB | CV          |
| ---            | ---                | ---       | ---         |
| [EfficientNet] | [EfficientNet-inf] | **0.900** | 0.89103     |
| [SE-ResNeXt50] | [SE-ResNeXt50-inf] | 0.899     | **0.89532** |
| [ViT]          | [ViT-inf]          | 0.899     | 0.89220     |

### üêé Ensemble and TTA

TTA Weight is the ratio between inference of original images and augmented images.
In other words weighted ensemble between no TTA and TTA.

| Inference        | Validation   | TTA | Public LB | CV     | TTA weight |
| ---              | ---          | --- | ---       | ---    | ---        |
| [inf-no-TTA]     | [val-no-TTA] | 1   | 0.905     | 0.9429 | -          |
| [inf-TTA]        | -            | 7   | 0.907     | -      | -          |
| [inf-TTA-weight] | -            | 7   | **0.908** | -      | 4:6        |

## ‚úèÔ∏è Memo

I've tried following techniques for this competition.

### üçÉ Datasets

- [Use 2019 datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/piantic/train-cassava-starter-using-various-loss-funcs/notebook)

### üõ†Ô∏è Preprocessing
